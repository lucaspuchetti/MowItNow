# MowItNow
Scala project. The aim of this project is to create a program that feds on an instructions file to manage one or several lawn mowers.

## Group Members of the project:
- Lotfi, Rana
- Puchetti, Lucas

## About the program
The program sets up lawn mowers that can perform two actions: Turn or move foward. Lawn mowers move sequentially, meaning that no two lawn mowers are functional at the same time. For more information, please consult "Projet Scala - M2 MoSEF - 2018/2020".
